# autowar
A fully functioning generator of 2 player games of the basic card game War. Made as a demo to practice simulation, modifying interval loops in real time via user input, decoupling using signals (events), and a few minor points of clear and concise UI design. Uses HTML/CSS and JavaScript (ECMAScript 2015, uses 'let' for local scoping).
